// Eligibility filtering of discover candidates against a ContributionProfile (#6798). Pure: given the candidate
// list and a per-repo profile map, it partitions candidates into kept + excluded-with-reason. No fetching, no
// side effects — discover-cli.js resolves the profiles and renders the result; this owns only the decision.
//
// SAFE-DEFAULT POSTURE (the load-bearing requirement) applies to the three LABEL-based rules only: filtering on
// them activates ONLY when a repo's profile has a trustworthy eligibility signal
// (eligibilityLabels.confidence === "explicit"). A repo with no profile, or a low-confidence/empty one — a repo
// whose conventions AMS simply couldn't read — has every candidate kept via those rules, so a weak profile can
// never cause AMS to silently skip real, eligible work.
//
// ASSIGNEE-EXCLUSION IS DIFFERENT (#7040): per the schema (ContributionAssigneeRuntimeCheck,
// contribution-profile.d.ts), it is deliberately NOT a profile field — it's a structural fact derivable from the
// issue's own assignees at query time, not something extraction infers with variable confidence. It therefore
// applies to EVERY candidate unconditionally, independent of the repo's ContributionProfile (or lack of one).
